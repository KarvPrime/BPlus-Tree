Lyrics based on: Amon Amarth - Guardians of Asgaard (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARnBgW5XgSo)

Standing firm against all odds
Guarding the most sacred tree
We protect the realm of nodes
Our destiny is carved in C

Some evil coders
From the University
Are constantly on the attack

With tests and benchmarks
From their minds
But we always run through quick

We are pointers
Of the code
Who are sharing Dennis Ritchie's plan

Searching down the tree branch path
We are spawned by coder tasks
Cause we are!

We're the guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Of B-Tree

We have faced some mistakes
A thousand times or even more

Still they cannot
Make us kneel
One billion years of constant bugs

The students look for
Any chance
To bring down buffers mighty bounds

No matter what they send at us
We will never let it fall
Cause we are!

We're the guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Of B-Tree

Standing firm
Against all odds
We are guarding
Buffer's mighty bounds
We protect
The realm of overflows
No matter
What they send at us
We will never
Let them fall

We're the guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Guardians of B-Tree
Guardians
Of B-Tree
